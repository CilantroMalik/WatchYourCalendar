# WatchYourCalendar
A minimal watch app that makes the flow of the school day conveniently available on your wrist!

-Glance at the app to see the Day, your next class, time until that class, the date, and the day-order!

-Click `Today` to see a more detailed, color-coded view of today: with times, past classes, your next class, upcoming classes...

-Click on a class or a free in the Day View to schedule an assessment or a meeting: then be reminded about it!

-Swipe left/right to see tomorrow's day or yesterday's-- or any day's! (Double tap to return to today!)

-Scroll throughout today to see which class you have at what time!

-Choose from numerous complications to see the cycle day, the day's order, your next class; the time until your next class, the time until your current class ends; the progress through the current class and the progress throughout the day!

-Allow notifications to tell you in the morning if you have sports that day or an assessment— or to tell you when lunch is ending— or to remind you that your next class starts in 5 minutes!

## Troubleshooting (Complications)
