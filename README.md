# WatchYourCalendar
A minimal watch app that makes the flow of the school day conveniently available on your wrist!

-Glance at the app to see the Day, your next class, time until that class, the date, and the day-order!

-Click `Today` to see a more detailed, color-coded view of today: with times, past classes, your next class, upcoming classes...

-Click on a class or a free in the Day View to schedule an assessment or a meeting: then be reminded about it!

-Swipe left/right to see tomorrow's day or yesterday's-- or any day's! (Double tap to return to today!)

-Scroll throughout today to see which class you have at what time!

-Choose from numerous complications to see the cycle day, the day's order, your next class; the time until your next class, the time until your current class ends; the progress through the current class and the progress throughout the day!

-Allow notifications to tell you in the morning if you have sports that day or an assessmentâ€” or to tell you when lunch is endingâ€” or to remind you that your next class starts in 5 minutes!
